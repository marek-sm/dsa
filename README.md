# 🧩 dsa — Data Structures & Algorithms

This repository contains my journey of practicing and mastering **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** through problem-solving, implementing data structures, studying algorithms, and building reference notes.

The focus is on writing clear, efficient, and well-documented solutions — not just getting the answer, but understanding the _why_ behind it.

- **`leetcode/`** → Solutions grouped by difficulty (easy, medium, hard). Each file includes problem statement, explanation, time/space complexity, and key data structures/algorithms used.
- **`data_structures/`** → Implementations of core data structures from scratch.
- **`algorithms/`** → Implementations of fundamental algorithms and patterns.
- **`tests/`** → Unit tests to verify correctness of implementations.
- **`notes/`** → Study notes, explanations of patterns, time/space analysis, and problem-solving insights.
- **`.gitignore`** → Prevents Python cache and other temporary files from being pushed to GitHub.

## 🛠️ Problem-Solving & Implementation Process

For each problem or implementation:

1. **Attempt independently** first (LeetCode, self-designed problems, or theoretical exercises).
2. **Document clearly**:
   - Problem statement or purpose of the implementation
   - Your solution / implementation
   - Time & space complexity
   - Key insights or alternative approaches
3. **Refine solutions** if a more efficient or elegant method is discovered.
4. **Testing**: write unit tests in `tests/` to ensure correctness.

## 📖 Goals

- Build a **solid foundation** in data structures and algorithms.
- Develop the habit of writing **clean, maintainable code**.
- Understand **time and space tradeoffs** in problem solving.
- Create a **reference repo** useful for interviews, projects, and learning reinforcement.
- Capture **learning reflections** and problem-solving patterns in `notes/`.

---

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python (primary)
- **Tools:** VS Code, Git, GitHub
- **Testing:** `unittest`

---

## ⚡ Notes

- This repo is for **learning, practice, and mastery**.
- Solutions may evolve over time as I revisit problems with fresh insights.
- Some explanations or summaries may have been enhanced with AI tools, but all code and final write-ups are reviewed and written by me.

## 📌 Next Steps

- ✅ Build out full repo structure
- 🚧 Add initial LeetCode solutions
- 🚧 Implement core data structures from scratch
- 🚧 Implement fundamental algorithms
- 🚧 Expand notes with complexity analysis, common patterns, and reflections
